### Restate Your Topic

*Why?* Up to this point,
if you've done your job well, everyone knows what the topic was.
Now is the time to be explicit about it. This would be a good
time to read your theme statement.

*Example*

```
I've spoken to you a lot about prayer and why it's important...
```

### Summarize Your Talk

*Why?* People learn through repetition. You've probably made several 
pertinent points throughout your talk. Summarize them bullet-point style.

*Example*

```
Prayer can help you learn God's will in your life.
It can bring a feeling of peace when you're troubled.
...
```

### Bear Your Testimony

*Why?* Ending with your tesimony is a powerful way to end, and serves
to reinforce your entire talk.

*Consider*: Bear your testimony about the truthfulness of your words, the
restored gospel, and the church.

### Close in the Name of the Savior

*Why?* It is appropriate and expected that you will close your talk in the
name of the Savior. However, avoid using the phrase "Thy Son" when closing. 
You are giving your talk to the congregation, not the Father. Thus, when you
close, you are still talking to them.
