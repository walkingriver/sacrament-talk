# Sacrament Talks

## Purpose
*Opinionated guide to giving sacarament talks by [@WalkingRiver](//twitter.com/walkingriver)*

If you are looking for an opinionated guide for ideas, thoughts, 
and suggestions on how to prepare and delivery a quality LDS Sacrament Meeting talk, you're in the right place.

## Community Awesomeness and Credit
Never work in a vacuum. There are many good speakers out there, and I am eager to learn from them. 

## Contributing
Open an issue first to discuss potential changes/additions. If you have questions, feel free to leave them as issues in the repository.
If you find a typo, create a pull request. The idea is to keep the content up to date and use github’s native feature to help tell 
the story with issues and PR’s, which are all searchable via google.
Why? Because odds are if you have a question, someone else does too! You can learn more here at about how to contribute.

*By contributing to this repository you are agreeing to make your content available subject to the license of this repository.*

### Process
    1. Discuss the changes in a GitHub issue.
    2. Open a Pull Request, reference the issue, and explain the change and why it adds value.
    3. The Pull Request will be evaluated and either merged or declined.

## Avoid Introductions

  - Do not introduce yourself
  
  *Why?*: You have already been introduced by the person conducting, and there is no reason to do it again. It only wastes time.
  
  *Exception*: If you were not introduced and do not know many people in the congregation, feel free to offer a brief introduction (no more than a few sentences).
  
  ```
  /* avoid */
  Hi. To those of you who don't know me, my name is Mike, and I've been in the ward for five years now.
