and suggestions on how to prepare and delivery a quality LDS Sacrament Meeting talk, you're in the right place.

## Community Awesomeness and Credit

## Starting Your Talk
It's hard to know just how to start a talk. In this section, I have provided a 
list of definite ways not to start yours, followed by a few really good methods.

### Do not introduce yourself
  
  *Why?* You have already been introduced by the person conducting, and there is no reason to do it again. It only wastes time.
  
  *Exception*: If you were not introduced and do not know many people in the congregation, feel free to offer a brief introduction (no more than a few sentences).
  
  ```
  /* avoid */
  Hi. To those of you who don't know me, my name is Mike, 
  and I've been in the ward for five years now.
  ```

### Never apologize for not being prepared enough

  *Why?* You're setting yourself up to fail. Most people won't notice whether or
  not you've prepared adequately. People understand you're nervous and will
  often give you the benefit of the doubt. 

  ```
  /* avoid */
  I didn't really have a lot of time to prepare, and just threw this talk
  together at the last minute.
  ```

### Do not start with a dictionary definiton of your topic

  *Why?* This is the mark of an ill-prepared speaker, and it feels lazy. 

  *Instead:* Start with a scripture or brief personal story that will help set the tone.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  The Bible Dictionary defines faith as ...
  
  /* consider */
  When I was eleven years old, I didn't fully understand the concept of faith or why 
  it was important. Then one day ...
  ```

### Do not announce your topic

  *Why?* A good talk doesn't need its topic announced. 

  *Instead:* Use your opening paragraph to provide the topic without resorting to an explicit statement.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  The bishop asked me to give a talk on prayer.

  /* consider */
  Each of us has problems that we cannot solve and weaknesses that we cannot conquer without 
  reaching out through prayer to a higher source of strength.* 
  ```
  
*[James E. Faust, “The Lifeline of Prayer,” Liahona, July 2002](https://www.lds.org/liahona/2002/07/the-lifeline-of-prayer?lang=eng)

### Don't complain about your assignment

  *Why?* Complaining about giving the talk is a lousy way to start. It sets the wrong tone,
  and tells everyone in the audience that you don't want to be there, and probably 
  didn't prepare well. 

  ```
  /* avoid */
  I didn't really want to do this...
  ```

### Don't pretend to want to be there if you are not

  *Why?* Most people will see through this weak attempt at humor.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  I am grateful for this opportunity...
  ```

### Don't question your assignment
    
  *Why?* Probably everyone who has evern spoken in front an audience has internally questioned their 
  fitness for the assigned topic. Explicitly questioning during your talk sets up an expectation of
  failure in your listeners. 

  *Instead:* Prepare your talk to ensure that the things you say are true and relevant.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  It's ironic that I was assigned this topic because I'm not very knowledgeable...

  /* avoid */
  You're supposed to write talks for other people to learn from, but i ended up learning more myself.
  ```

## Effectively Delivering Your Talk

### Stay on Topic

 *Why?* This is also known as a "Great Pumpkin monologue" from the Peanuts cartoon. Linus is speaking on a specific topic, and
suddenly announces, "But first, a few words on the Great Pumpkin." It's important that you avoid rambling and that you
stay on topic. 

### Speak Slowly, Clearly and Loudly

 *Why?* Be careful not to mumble. Many people when speaking in public get nervous. This is natural. When that happens, they
often start speaking too quickly and sometimes mumble. When you feel yourself starting to get nervous, pause at the
end of a paragraph, take a deep breath, and restart the next paragraph slowly and clearly.

Another common mistake is to speak too softly. You don't want to shout, but should be loud enough that people can 
hear you anywhere in the room. 

If you are using a PA system, as is common in every chapel, try to position the microphone to be approximately 10-12
inches from your mouth. Speak up, but let those conducting the meeting worry about the volume. 

### My Eye Contact

 *Why?* It's important to make a connection with your audience. You do that by making eye contact with them. As you begin to
speak, look around the room and try to pick out a friendly face (or 5). As you deliver your talk, try to move your
eyes between your paper and those people you've chosen.

An alternative to this strategy is to look at the back of the room, just above the heads of those in the very back.
To most people in the audience, this will appear that you are making eye contact with those behind them. It is not
as desirable, but may help if you have a hard time finding enough friendly faces.

### Never Ask for Audience Feedback

 *Why?* A common mistake many public speakers make is to ask too many questions that require the audience to respond, either
physically (raised hands) or verbally. In sacrament meetings, it is almost always inappropriate to ask your listeners
to respond to questions (or greetings). 

 *Exception*: In a classroom or 
professional setting, asking the audience to raise their hands once is acceptable. For example, asking 
the listeners who is familiar with the topic is common. Asking a second question is sometimes warranted as a follow-up,
but three times in a single talk is overkill, and audiences don't care for it.

### Don't Ask Your Audience to Look Up a Scripture

 *Why?* This is a delaying tactic. Many speakers who don't have enough material will ask listeners to turn to a specific
scripture before they read it. We have been counseled by church leaders not to do this.

### Don't Use Long, Irrelevant Quotes with No Additional Analysis

*Why?* Reading relevant scriptures or quotes can add a lot of power
and authority to your talk. Some people make the mistake of using really
long scriptures or quotes, and never bridge the gap with their audiences as to 
its relevance. 

*Do*: If you read a quote or scripture, finish with a sentence that ties
it back to your topic.

### Use Stories
  
*Why?* Humans are story-telling creatures. Everyone loves a good story,
whether it's delivered on paper, in a movie, a TV show, or verbally. 
The best talks use a lot of stories to get their points across to their
audiences. 

*Avoid*: Don't use stories that are not pertinent to your topic.

*Consider*: Start your talk with a story related to your topic. this
will pull your audience into your talk emotionally, and effectively
communicate your topic.

### Avoid Overused Stories

*Why?* Many stories have been told so many times, that people are tired
of hearing them. Rather than bolster your talk, telling an oft-told
story could cause people to tune out. 

*Examples*:
  - The starfish washed up on the beach
  - Footprints in the sand

### Don't Read Song Lyrics or Poems

*Why?* Reading song lyrics is corny. Don't do it. As for poetry,
very few people can do this well. Unless you are absolutely sure about
your abilities, don't try it.

*Exception*: Using a single line from a song to make a point may be acceptable
(e.g., "As it says in 'The Iron Rod,' 'The word of God will safely guide us through.").

*Consider*: If you insist on using poetry, make sure to practice your
recitation to a trusted person who will give you honest and constructive feedback.

### Don't Use Props or Visual Aids

*Why?* This is counsel we have received from church leadership. A 
sacrament talk should stand on its own. It isn't Show & Tell.
Leave your trophies, candles, and pumpkins for a lesson.

## Wrapping Up

You've given the perfect talk, with great stories and thoughtful insights.
Now you need to finish.

### Restate Your Topic

*Why?* Up to this point,
if you've done your job well, everyone knows what the topic was.
Now is the time to be explicit about it. 

*Example*

```
I've spoken to you a lot about prayer and why it's important...
```

### Summarize Your Talk

*Why?* People learn through repetition. You've probably made several 
pertinent points throughout your talk. Summarize them bullet-point style.

*Example*

```
Prayer can help you learn God's will in your life.
It can bring a feeling of peace when you're troubled.
...
```

### Bear Your Testimony

*Why?* Ending with your tesimony is a powerful way to end, and serves
to reinforce your entire talk.

*Consider*: Bear your testimony about the truthfulness of your words, the
restored gospel, and the church.

### Close in the Name of the Savior

*Why?* It is appropriate and expected that you will close your talk in the
name of the Savior. However, avoid using the phrase "Thy Son" when closing. 
You are giving your talk to the congregation, not the Father. Thus, when you
close, you are still talking to them.
