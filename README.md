*Opinionated guide to giving sacrament talks by [@WalkingRiver](//twitter.com/walkingriver)*

If you are looking for an opinionated guide for ideas, thoughts, 
and suggestions on how to prepare and delivery a quality LDS Sacrament Meeting talk, you're in the right place.

## Community Awesomeness and Credit
Never work in a vacuum. There are many good speakers out there, and I am eager to learn from them. 

## Contributing
Open an issue first to discuss potential changes/additions. If you have questions, feel free to leave them as issues in the repository.
If you find a typo, create a pull request. The idea is to keep the content up to date and use github’s native feature to help tell 
the story with issues and PR’s, which are all searchable via google.
Why? Because odds are if you have a question, someone else does too! You can learn more here at about how to contribute.

## Starting Your Talk
It's hard to know just how to start a talk. In this section, I have provided a 
list of definite ways not to start yours, followed by a few really good methods.

### Do not introduce yourself
  
  *Why?* You have already been introduced by the person conducting, and there is no reason to do it again. It only wastes time.
  
  *Exception*: If you were not introduced and do not know many people in the congregation, feel free to offer a brief introduction (no more than a few sentences).
  
  ```
  /* avoid */
  Hi. To those of you who don't know me, my name is Mike, 
  and I've been in the ward for five years now.
  ```

### Never apologize for not being prepared enough

  *Why?* You're setting yourself up to fail. Most people won't notice whether or
  not you've prepared adequately. People understand you're nervous and will
  often give you the benefit of the doubt. 

  ```
  /* avoid */
  I didn't really have a lot of time to prepare, and just threw this talk
  together at the last minute.
  ```

### Do not start with a dictionary definiton of your topic

  *Why?* This is the mark of an ill-prepared speaker, and it feels lazy. 
  *Instead:* Start with a scripture or brief personal story that will help set the tone.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  The Bible Dictionary defines faith as ...
  
  /* consider */
  When I was eleven years old, I didn't fully understand the concept of faith or why 
  it was important. Then one day ...
  ```

### Do not announce your topic

  *Why?* A good talk doesn't need its topic announced. 
  *Instead:* Use your opening paragraph to provide the topic without resorting to an explicit statement.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  The bishop asked me to give a talk on prayer.

  /* consider */
  Each of us has problems that we cannot solve and weaknesses that we cannot conquer without 
  reaching out through prayer to a higher source of strength.* 
  ```
  
*[James E. Faust, “The Lifeline of Prayer,” Liahona, July 2002](https://www.lds.org/liahona/2002/07/the-lifeline-of-prayer?lang=eng)

### Don't complain about your assignment

  *Why?* Complaining about giving the talk is a lousy way to start. It sets the wrong tone,
  and tells everyone in the audience that you don't want to be there, and probably 
  didn't prepare well. 

  ```
  /* avoid */
  I didn't really want to do this...
  ```

### Don't pretend to want to be there if you are not

  *Why?* Most people will see through this weak attempt at humor.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  I am grateful for this opportunity...
  ```

### Don't question your assignment
    
  *Why?* Probably everyone who has evern spoken in front an audience has internally questioned their 
  fitness for the assigned topic. Explicitly questioning during your talk sets up an expectation of
  failure in your listeners. 

  *Instead:* Prepare your talk to ensure that the things you say are true and relevant.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  It's ironic that I was assigned this topic because I'm not very knowledgeable...

  /* avoid */
  You're supposed to write talks for other people to learn from, but i ended up learning more myself.
  ```

## Effectively Delivering Your Talk

### Don't ramble
Great Pumpkin monologue (with pumpkins)


### Speak Clearly and Loudly
Mumble

### Don't Stare constantly at paper
 Pick a friendly face (or 5)

### Never elicit audience feedback

### Don't ask your audience to look up a scripture

### Don't use long irrelevant quotes with no additional analysis

### Stories
  - Start with a story related to your topic

### Avoid Cliché

### Don't read song lyrics / poems

### Don't use props

## Wrapping Up

### Restate your topic

### Summarize your talk

### Bear your testimony

### Be Careful with your ending
 - Don't End in the name of thy son...
